bettertron uses several command line tools that are expected to exist:

*lame
*flac
*mktorrent

If you are running ubuntu/debian, this should get all of them:

apt-get install mktorrent flac lame


After that, simply fill out the values in better.ini:

username and password refer to your what.cd username and password

torrentdir is where bettertron will create torrents for your transcodes
flacdir is where bettertron will look for your already existing and seeded flacs
transcodedir is where your flac transcodes will end up
