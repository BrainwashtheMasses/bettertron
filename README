bettertron uses several command line tools that are expected to exist:

*lame
*flac
*mktorrent

If you are running ubuntu/debian, this should get all of them:

apt-get install mktorrent flac lame
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This project uses some pre-existing perl modules from CPAN. To install them in Ubuntu/debian (and probaly anything else) in one line:

sudo perl -MCPAN -e 'install WWW::Mechanize, JSON, JSON::XS, Data::Dumper, Config::IniFiles, Bencode'
---------------------------------------------------------------------
After that, simply run the better.pl script once. It will generate a config file called better.ini

Please fill it out:

username and password refer to your what.cd username and password

torrentdir is where bettertron will create torrents for your transcodes
flacdir is where bettertron will look for your already existing and seeded flacs
transcodedir is where your flac transcodes will end up
---------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO:

*Handle torrent upload errors more gracefully (had a couple rejected due to thumb.db restriction. 
Imagine 1982/original release/CD media will be a problem also)
*Better error or unexpected condition handling.
